Company style guide as the base layer, individual profiles on top. Each field shows the company default with a one-click reset, so you can see exactly what's customized per executive. Refine any executive's voice in plain English: say "make it more conversational" or "add more data points," and YourTake shows a before/after comparison so the comms team can validate the change before applying it.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Yes. Your company style guide serves as the base layer: brand messaging, tone guidelines, topics to focus on or avoid. On top of that, each executive gets their own voice profile built from their real LinkedIn posts and writing exemplars. The CMO's posts will sound distinctly different from the CTO's, while both stay on-brand.

              You're probably a strong prompter already. The difference isn't the AI. It's the system. YourTake is purpose-built for LinkedIn: it maintains persistent voice profiles per executive, stores your research in a content library, discovers evidence-backed angles from your source material, and generates in 4 formats with hook variants. Every workflow, template, and quality filter is preconfigured with LinkedIn best practices. It's a structured system that maintains voice consistency across your entire leadership team, not a chatbox you have to re-prompt every time.

          <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
            <div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Yes. Each voice profile imports real LinkedIn posts as writing exemplars and captures tone, vocabulary, and structure preferences. Our anti-AI-slop filtering prevents clichés, corporate jargon, and throat-clearing, the patterns that make AI content feel generic. The result sounds like your executive wrote it, not like a template.

              Your comms team always has final control. Every claim in a generated post is backed by evidence from your content library and verified web sources. No hallucinated statistics or quotes.
