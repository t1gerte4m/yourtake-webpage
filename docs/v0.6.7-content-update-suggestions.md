# YourTake v0.6.7 Website Content Update Suggestions

_For Mike to work through with the website builder agent. Created Feb 25, 2026._

## Overview

YourTake Studio has shipped significant new features that aren't reflected on yourtake.ai. This document provides copy suggestions, placement recommendations, and strategic framing for each page. Multiple options are provided where the approach matters.

**New features to add:**
1. Campaign Planner & Executor (biggest gap)
2. Executive Multi-Profile Overlay + "Build from Exemplars"
3. Weekly Performance Checkpoints
4. Style Guide Refinement (plain English + auto-learning)
5. Evidence Gathering (per-post, automated)

**Voice rules (apply everywhere):**
- Say "platform," never "tool"
- No jargon: no "LLM," "Perplexity," "AI agents," "prompting"
- No em dashes
- Lead with the user's problem, not the feature

## Page 1: For Agencies (`/for-agencies/`)

This page is the highest priority. Agencies are the primary sales target and campaign planning is the #1 differentiator for them.

### Current State
The page covers: content library, Discover, multi-format Create, style guides, approval workflow, and a pilot program offer. The "How It Works" section is a 5-step post-by-post flow. There's no mention of campaign planning, performance tracking, executive voice extraction, or style guide refinement.

### Addition 1: Campaign Planner Section

**Placement:** After the current "Meet YourTake" benefits section, before "How It Works." This is the biggest new capability and should be prominent.

**Option A: "Plan Campaigns, Not Just Posts" (Recommended)**

Why this works: Directly addresses agency pain of ad hoc content scrambling. Frames the feature as strategic, not tactical. Agencies sell campaigns to clients, not individual posts.

```
Plan Campaigns, Not Just Posts

Stop scrambling week to week. Set a campaign goal, define your audience,
and YourTake researches themes based on real industry data and trends.

- Set the strategy: goals, audience, and scheduling preferences
- AI researches themes mapped to your funnel (awareness, consideration, decision, retention)
- Get a week-by-week content calendar with posts pre-assigned by topic, format, and objective
- Open any slot and generate the post right there
- Track what's working and adapt based on real performance data

One hour of planning. A month of content. Per client.
```

**Option B: "From Strategy to Calendar in Minutes"**

Why this works: Emphasizes speed, which is the primary agency constraint. Less strategic framing, more operational.

```
From Strategy to Calendar in Minutes

Tell YourTake who you're targeting and what you're trying to achieve.
It researches themes, maps them to your funnel, and builds a content
calendar your team can execute.

- Campaign wizard: goal, audience, themes, scheduling, review
- AI-powered research surfaces industry trends, data points, and relevant topics
- Content calendar auto-generated with format mix and funnel position per post
- Each calendar slot opens directly in Create for generation
- Pause, resume, or adapt campaigns based on performance
```

**Recommendation:** Option A. "Plan Campaigns, Not Just Posts" is a stronger contrast statement and matches how agencies think about their deliverables. The "one hour of planning, a month of content, per client" line is a memorable anchor.

### Addition 2: Performance Tracking Section

**Placement:** Immediately after the campaign section (they're a natural pair).

**Option A: "Track What's Working" (Recommended)**

Why this works: Agencies need to prove ROI to clients. This section shows YourTake helps them do that, not just create content.

```
Track What's Working

Log engagement metrics per post. After three posts, YourTake builds a
baseline and starts scoring each new post as outperforming, average,
or needs attention.

- Weekly AI-powered reviews: best-performing format, best theme, what to adjust
- Data-driven adaptation, not guesswork
- Give clients performance reports that show your team is optimizing, not just posting
```

**Option B: "Campaigns That Get Smarter"**

Why this works: Frames the tracking as intelligence, not just measurement. More forward-looking.

```
Campaigns That Get Smarter

Every post adds signal. YourTake tracks engagement, identifies your
top-performing formats and themes, and recommends weekly adjustments.

- Automatic performance scoring after your first few posts
- Weekly checkpoint: what worked, what to change, what to try next
- Shift from "hope it works" to "we know what works for this client"
```

**Recommendation:** Option A for agencies (they need the client-facing reporting angle). Option B is better for the /for-professionals page.

### Addition 3: Executive Voice Extraction

**Placement:** Expand the existing "Your Voice, Built In" section.

**Add to existing copy:**
```
Build any executive's voice profile in under 5 minutes. Paste 3-5 of their
LinkedIn posts, and YourTake auto-extracts their tone, vocabulary,
sentence structure, pacing, and formality. Layer executive voices on top
of the company style guide, so 80% of the context is shared and each
person still sounds like themselves.
```

Why this matters for agencies: The 80/20 framing (shared company context + individual voice) is exactly how agencies work. When a company's positioning changes, update once and it flows to all executives.

### Addition 4: Style Guide Refinement

**Placement:** Add as a bullet under "Your Voice, Built In" section.

```
Refine any style guide in plain English. Say "make the tone more
authoritative" or "shorter hooks," and YourTake proposes specific changes
with a before/after comparison. It also learns from your edits over time
and suggests updates automatically.
```

### Update: "How It Works" Flow

**Current:** Save Sources > Discover > Create > Refine > Publish (5 steps, post-by-post)

**Suggestion:** Keep the current flow but add a second path for campaigns.

**Option A: Two paths side by side**
```
How It Works

Post by post:
1. Save Your Sources
2. Discover What to Post
3. Create in Any Format
4. Refine With YourTake
5. Publish

Or plan a campaign:
1. Set Your Campaign Goal
2. AI Researches Themes
3. Review Your Content Calendar
4. Create Each Post (from the calendar)
5. Track Performance
6. Adapt Weekly
```

**Option B: Single unified flow (Recommended)**
```
How It Works

1. Build Your Voice (style guides from real posts, per client or executive)
2. Plan or Discover (campaign calendar or one-off topic discovery)
3. Create in Any Format (posts, carousels, video scripts, infographics)
4. Refine and Approve (edit, review, client sign-off)
5. Track and Adapt (performance metrics, weekly AI reviews)
```

**Recommendation:** Option B. Cleaner, doesn't force users to choose a path, and naturally includes the new features without making the page longer.

### FAQ Updates

Add to existing FAQ:

```
Q: Can we plan multi-week campaigns, not just individual posts?
A: Yes. Set a campaign goal, define your audience, and YourTake researches
themes and builds a week-by-week content calendar. Each slot opens
directly in Create, so your team executes from the calendar instead of
starting from scratch each week.

Q: How do we track what's working?
A: Log engagement metrics per post. After a few posts, YourTake builds a
performance baseline and scores each new post. Weekly AI-powered reviews
surface your best formats, themes, and recommendations for what to adjust.
```

## Page 2: For Teams (`/for-teams/`)

### Current State
The page covers executive voice profiles, company base layer + individual overlays, multi-format creation, Discover, and editorial control. Missing: Build from Exemplars, campaign planning, performance tracking, style guide refinement.

### Addition 1: "Build from Exemplars"

**Placement:** Expand the existing "One Brand, Many Voices" section.

**Add:**
```
Get any executive posting in under 5 minutes. Paste 3-5 of their existing
LinkedIn posts, and YourTake auto-extracts their personal voice: tone,
vocabulary, sentence structure, pacing, and formality. Each field shows
the company default with a one-click reset, so you can see exactly what's
being customized per executive.
```

Why this matters for teams: The cold-start problem is real. Comms teams need to onboard executives fast. "5 minutes" is the key claim.

### Addition 2: Campaign Planning

**Placement:** New section after "Choose Your Own Adventure."

```
Plan Content Across Your Leadership Team

Set monthly themes per executive. YourTake researches topics based on
their expertise and your company's priorities, then builds a content
calendar your comms team can execute.

- Coordinate posting across executives without a shared spreadsheet
- Each executive's calendar respects their voice profile and topic focus
- Weekly reviews show which executives are resonating and which themes need adjustment
```

Why this framing: Teams care about coordination (not stepping on each other's topics) and executive buy-in (showing results). The "without a shared spreadsheet" line hits a real pain point.

### Addition 3: Style Guide Refinement

**Placement:** Add under the voice section.

```
Refine any executive's voice in plain English. Say "make it more
conversational" or "add more data points," and YourTake shows a
before/after comparison so the comms team can validate the change
before applying it.
```

### FAQ Update

```
Q: What if an executive's voice evolves over time?
A: Refine any voice profile in plain English. Describe the change you
want, review a before/after comparison post, and accept or adjust.
YourTake also learns from your editing patterns and suggests updates
automatically.
```

---

## Page 3: For Professionals (`/for-professionals/`)

### Current State
Covers voice authenticity, Discover, multi-format creation, and the "messy process" framing. Missing: campaign planning (simpler), style guide refinement.

### Addition 1: Campaign Planning (Simple Framing)

**Placement:** After "Works With Your Messy Process" or as a new section before the pilot offer.

**Option A: "Plan Your Month, Not Just Your Next Post" (Recommended)**

```
Plan Your Month, Not Just Your Next Post

Set a goal for the month. YourTake researches themes based on your
expertise and what your audience cares about, then builds a content
calendar you can follow or ignore.

- No rigid schedules. Adapt as you go.
- Always know what you're posting next (no more blank page anxiety)
- Track which posts resonate and adjust your approach
```

Why this framing: Professionals resist "content calendars" (the page already says "no rigid content calendar required"). This copy leans into flexibility while still offering structure for those who want it.

**Option B: "From Scrambling to Strategic"**

```
From Scrambling to Strategic

Instead of figuring out what to post every Monday morning, spend one
session planning your month. YourTake researches themes, builds a
flexible content calendar, and tracks what's working so you can do
more of it.
```

**Recommendation:** Option A. The "plan or ignore" framing matches the existing page tone of "works with your messy process."

### Addition 2: Style Guide Refinement

**Placement:** Expand the "Sound Like You" section.

```
Your voice evolves. So should your style guide. Describe what you want
to change in plain English, like "shorter hooks" or "more conversational."
YourTake shows a before/after comparison so you can see the difference
before accepting. It also picks up on patterns in your edits and suggests
updates automatically.
```

Why this matters: Professionals often don't know their voice has drifted until they see a comparison. The auto-learning angle is compelling for people who don't want to manually maintain a style guide.

## Page 4: Homepage (`/index.html`)

### Current State
Hero: "Scale LinkedIn Content, Not Your Headcount." Three persona cards. Four benefit cards: Never Run Out of Ideas, Your Voice Built In, Four Formats, More Content Less Effort. 5-step How It Works. Testimonials. FAQ.

### Suggested Updates

**Update benefit card #1 or add a 5th card:**

Current "Never Run Out of Ideas" could be expanded or a new card added:

```
Plan Your Month in Minutes

Set a campaign goal, and YourTake researches themes and builds a content
calendar. Track what works and adapt weekly. Go from one-off posts to a
strategic content plan.
```

**Update "Your Voice, Built In" card:**
Add one line about Build from Exemplars:
```
Paste a few LinkedIn posts and YourTake extracts the voice automatically.
Refine it anytime in plain English.
```

**Update "How It Works":**
Same unified flow suggested for the agencies page:
1. Build Your Voice
2. Plan or Discover
3. Create in Any Format
4. Refine and Approve
5. Track and Adapt

## Cross-Page Notes

### Evidence Gathering Enhancement
Currently all pages say some version of "pulls credible sources." The new per-post evidence gathering is more powerful: it scans your content library AND searches the web for supporting evidence, with quality filtering. Suggested upgrade across all pages:

**Current:** "Pulls credible sources so posts feel authoritative"
**Updated:** "Automatically finds supporting evidence for every post, from your content library and the broader web, filtered for quality and relevance"

This is a subtle but meaningful upgrade. "Automatically finds supporting evidence for every post" is more specific and impressive than "pulls credible sources."

### Testimonial Opportunities
The pages currently use quotes from Reagan A., Natalie M., Curtis R., Lee S., Keisha J., Nicole C., and Greg C. If any of these users have said something about the campaign planner or executive overlay features, those quotes would be valuable additions. Check recent meeting notes for relevant quotes.

From the Bob Hood call (Feb 24), Ann Hawkins said: "I like it that it goes through your industries and directs it, because for us, that's critical." This could be used on /for-agencies or /for-teams with permission.

### Calendly Link Audit
- Homepage CTA: Should link to `/yourtake/marketers` (currently does)
- For Agencies: Should link to `/yourtake/marketers`
- For Teams: Should link to `/yourtake/marketers`
- For Professionals: Should link to `/yourtake/founders`
- Slicksheet: Currently links to `/yourtake/30min` (LEGACY, needs to be `/yourtake/marketers`)
