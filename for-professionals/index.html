              Yes. Your style guide is built from your actual LinkedIn posts and other content: tone, structure, vocabulary, topics. We import your posts as writing exemplars so YourTake learns your natural patterns. Plus anti-AI-slop filtering prevents the "template feel" that kills authenticity. No clichés, no corporate jargon, no throat-clearing. No more taking AI output to ChatGPT to humanize it.

              ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbox you re-prompt every time. YourTake is a content studio purpose-built for LinkedIn: it stores your research in a content library, discovers angles from your saved material (not hallucinated), generates in 4 formats with hook variants, and learns your voice over time through a persistent style guide. Every workflow, template, and quality filter is preconfigured with LinkedIn best practices, so you're not starting from scratch every session. It's the difference between a text generator and a system built for LinkedIn.

              Good. You don't need one. Drop in articles, voice memos, notes, whatever inspires you. YourTake organizes it into your content library and surfaces what to write about. It works with your messy, organic process, not against it. As one user put it: "This is actually much more aligned to what I already do. It doesn't feel like I'd have to contort my brain to fit into a calendar."

              You always have final control. Every claim in a generated post is backed by evidence from your content library and verified web sources. No hallucinated statistics or quotes. You can edit any draft in a split-screen view with live LinkedIn preview. Think of YourTake's draft as 80% done. Add your expert polish and it's yours.

              Neither. YourTake amplifies your thinking. It takes your ideas, your research, your perspective and structures them into polished content. The Discover feature surfaces angles from your own saved material, not generic AI suggestions. You choose the direction at every step. It's augmentation, not replacement.

              We actively fight repetition. Hook variants ensure your posts don't all start the same way. The Discover feature pulls from your full content library to surface diverse angles across topics, not just your core pitch. And you can expand your library at any time with broader industry content, ensuring fresh perspectives.
