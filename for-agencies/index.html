              Yes. Each client gets their own style guide, built from their existing LinkedIn posts, blog content, and brand guidelines. We import their posts as writing exemplars so YourTake learns their tone, vocabulary, and structure. On top of that, our anti-AI-slop filtering actively prevents clichés, corporate jargon, and throat-clearing. Early users say even their clients can't tell the difference.

              Your existing team remains crucial. YourTake handles first-draft writing and streamlines approvals, but human creativity and strategy stay at the helm. Think of it as an assistant that frees your team from drudgery so they can focus on strategy, campaign ideas, and refining messaging. Many agencies repurpose freed time to service more clients or improve performance.

              You and your client always have final control. Every claim in a generated post is backed by evidence from your source material. No hallucinated statistics or quotes.

              ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbox. YourTake is a content studio purpose-built for LinkedIn: it stores your research in a content library, discovers post-worthy angles backed by your actual sources, generates in 4 formats with hook variants, and maintains per-client voice profiles. Every workflow, template, and quality filter is preconfigured with LinkedIn best practices, so your team isn't re-engineering prompts for every client. It's the difference between a text generator and a complete workspace.

              Only if you tell them. The client sees a polished draft and an approve button. They don't see how it's made. Many agencies present YourTake as an internal efficiency tool. The content is original and human-like; there's no sign of the "AI voice" that people worry about. You maintain full ownership and editorial control.
